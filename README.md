### 👋 About:

Created as an academic project for the [WMDD program at Langara](https://langara.ca/programs-and-courses/programs/web-and-mobile-app/index.html), the purpose of this project was to develop a mobile application within 13 weeks, using either React Native or with Android Studio and XCode.

Colourfit helps fashionistas and vision-impaired individuals identify the colours of their clothing and receive outfit suggestions based on what colours best compliment their skin tone and hair color. Our app allows users to experiment with different colour combinations and gain confidence in the way they present and express themselves.

### 🌈 Main Features:

**📸 Colour Scanning:**
- When the user first creates their account, our onboarding process guides them to use the in-app camera to scan their neck or arm, providing an estimate of the HEX code and colour name of their skin tone.
- Users can scan their outfits to get accurate information and details about the clothing's dominant colours.

**👚 Outfit Suggestions:**
- ☝️ Based on **personal colour:**
	- *Personal colour*, or *colour analysis*, is a method of determining the palette range of someone's skin complexion, hair, and eye colour. Our app compares the user's scanned attributes against a collection of popular *seasonal palettes* and suggests outfits that harmonize with their personal colour.
- ✌️ Based on **current season:**
	- Our app utilizes the selection of colours and applies it to our clothing illustrations. The suggested clothing types will correspond to the user's current geolocation, season, and weather.

**🗂️ Virtual Closets:**
- Colourfit offers the creation of closets, allowing users to sort their scanned clothing into different (unlimited!) collections as they see fit, such as by event occasion or by a particular palette they liked.
- Custom closets can shorten the time taken for users to pick outfits, so they can quickly and easily reference them at any time.
